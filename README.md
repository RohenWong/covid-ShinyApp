# Multi-Omics COVID Shiny app

Project as part of DATA3888: Data Science Capstone, at the University of Sydney (2021). Collaborators include Youheng Yao, Abdullah Safi, Benjamin Boey and Ruilin Zhou. The unit was coordinated by Dr. Jean Yang. 

This app explores the use of multi-omics (proteomics, metalobomics, transcriptomics) for identifying severe/moderate covid-19 cases. Users can upload their own omics for prediction. The Shiny app is hosted [here](https://rwon.shinyapps.io/Multi-Omics-COVID-risk-app/). 

The folder `demo_uploading_files` contains 2 demo datasets - one from Su et al. (2020), another from Shen et al. (2020). The clinical data and `.csv` omics from each can be uploaded to the app to get predictions. 

*Note:* pdata, mdata and rdata refer to proteomics, metabolomics and transcriptomics respectively.
